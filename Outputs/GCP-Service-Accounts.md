## Recommendations

1. Delete any permanently disabled accounts you no longer need:
   ```bash
   gcloud iam service-accounts delete \
     broken-sa@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
2. Audit all service accounts for least-privilege IAM roles.
3. Rotate keys and consider workload identity federation where possible.

**How to use these:**  
1. After running `python3 -m scanner.scanner --project YOUR_PROJ --output report.json`, parse `report.json` into tables.  
2. Copy the generated tables into each `GCP-*.md` under your repoâ€™s `outputs/` directory.  
3. Commit and push so your colleagues or CI artifacts include both the raw JSON and human-readable Markdown reports.
